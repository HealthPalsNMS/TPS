# TPS

How To Run The Code:
Run the first code and upload the dataset
Run the next two programs to save the dataset to dataframe
The next program shows the first five patients record. Click on the play button to run the code.
The following code after running shows the no. of rows and columns respectively.
Further code, filters out patients with age 50 and above and then after running the next code the data base get's filtered out and the output is showcased.
The next coding line showcases only top 5 patients from the result of the filter, this line is optional depending upon the requirement of filtered data.
Following code has another filter, which sorts those patients who were charged more than â‚¹700.
The further 2 coding line after running installs pytorch python package(torch,torchvision).
Further code imports torch, torch.nn as variable name nn and matplotlib.pyplot as plt.
The next line, gives description of the data in the DataFrame.
Following lines after running import numpy python package as np, seaborn as sns and from the sklearn.linear_model pachages imports LinearRegression(Ai Model used in the code.)
hrough the last line, A linear regression  is generated, giving the final output and showing which age group has the highest cholesterol level(*Note 1 refers to the cholesterol level being low, 2 normal and 3 high respectively.)
